        "when": "Optimally, threat modelling should be done at an early stage of the development as it can save significant resources on risk mitigation during a later phase.<br><br>Cyber security, threat and technology landscape is constantly evolving, it's also important to perform Threat Modelling on existing systems, applications or features to identify new threats and vulnerabilities.<br>In the absence of new feature development or enhancement, threat modelling should be revisited as part of support and maintenance activities.",
